# Task ID: 9
# Title: Update CI/CD Pipeline with New Build Process
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Update the CI/CD pipeline to incorporate the new build process, including caching for dependencies and proper versioning.
# Details:
Update the CI/CD pipeline configuration to incorporate the new build optimizations:

1. Configure dependency caching
2. Implement proper versioning
3. Update build and deployment steps

For GitHub Actions:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/build-deploy.yml
name: Build and Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
      
      - name: Build application
        run: npm run build
      
      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2
      
      - name: Cache Docker layers
        uses: actions/cache@v3
        with:
          path: /tmp/.buildx-cache
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-buildx-${{ github.sha }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-buildx-
      
      - name: Build and push Docker image
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v4
        with:
          context: .
          push: ${{ github.event_name != 'pull_request' }}
          tags: ampshare:${{ github.sha }}
          cache-from: type=local,src=/tmp/.buildx-cache
          cache-to: type=local,dest=/tmp/.buildx-cache-new
      
      # Move cache to prevent it from growing indefinitely
      - name: Move cache
        run: |
          rm -rf /tmp/.buildx-cache
          mv /tmp/.buildx-cache-new /tmp/.buildx-cache
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Test the CI/CD pipeline with the new configuration
2. Verify build caching works correctly
3. Compare build times in CI before and after changes
4. Test deployment to ensure the application works correctly
