      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Web Component Registration Singleton",
      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of the Web Component Registration Singleton into subtasks including: 1) Creating the registry.ts file with the Set for tracking registered components, 2) Implementing the registerWebComponent function with duplicate registration prevention, and 3) Writing unit tests to verify the functionality works as expected.",
      "reasoning": "This is a relatively straightforward implementation of a singleton pattern with clear requirements and example code already provided. The task involves creating a single file with a simple data structure and function. The complexity is low but still requires careful implementation to ensure proper component registration."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Error Handling for Web Components",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of Error Handling for Web Components into subtasks including: 1) Creating the safeRegisterWebComponent function with try/catch blocks, 2) Implementing the WebComponentErrorBoundary React component, 3) Creating the fallback UI for failed components, and 4) Writing comprehensive tests for error scenarios.",
      "reasoning": "This task has moderate complexity as it involves both error handling logic and creating a React error boundary component. It requires understanding of both the web component registration system and React's error handling mechanisms. The implementation needs to gracefully handle failures and provide appropriate fallbacks."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Centralize Web Component Registration",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Centralized Web Component Registration implementation into subtasks including: 1) Creating the index.ts file structure, 2) Implementing the registerAllComponents function, 3) Setting up Hot Module Replacement support, 4) Ensuring proper component import and registration, and 5) Writing tests to verify centralized registration works correctly.",
      "reasoning": "This task has higher complexity as it involves refactoring the existing component registration approach into a centralized system. It requires knowledge of all existing components, proper HMR setup, and ensuring components are registered only once. The implementation needs to work with the previously created registration singleton."

      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Multi-stage Docker Build",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Multi-stage Docker Build implementation into subtasks including: 1) Creating the initial Dockerfile with build stage, 2) Implementing the production stage with minimal dependencies, 3) Setting up proper security configurations including non-root user, and 4) Testing the Docker build process and verifying image size optimization.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating a multi-stage Dockerfile which has moderate complexity. The implementation details are well-defined in the PRD, but proper implementation requires understanding of Docker build processes, layer optimization, and security best practices. Testing the build and verifying optimizations adds some complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Optimize Docker Layer Caching",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Docker Layer Caching optimization into subtasks including: 1) Creating a comprehensive .dockerignore file, 2) Implementing the dependencies stage for optimal caching, 3) Setting up the builder and runner stages with proper file copying, and 4) Testing build times and cache effectiveness with various change scenarios.",
      "reasoning": "This task builds on the previous Docker implementation but focuses on optimizing layer caching, which requires deeper understanding of Docker's caching mechanisms. It involves creating a more complex three-stage build process and requires careful testing to ensure caching works effectively under different change scenarios."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Configure Next.js for Production Optimization",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Next.js Production Optimization configuration into subtasks including: 1) Implementing core Next.js optimization settings, 2) Configuring image optimization parameters, 3) Setting up experimental features for performance gains, 4) Implementing custom webpack configurations for tree shaking, and 5) Testing and measuring performance improvements.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires in-depth knowledge of Next.js configuration options and performance optimization techniques. It involves modifying webpack configurations and enabling various optimization features. The complexity comes from understanding the performance implications of each setting and ensuring they work together without conflicts."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Lazy Loading for Non-Critical Components",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Lazy Loading implementation into subtasks including: 1) Creating the lazy-registry.ts file with core functionality, 2) Implementing the lazyLoadComponent function with proper error handling, 3) Setting up the Intersection Observer for visibility detection, 4) Creating the setupLazyComponents function, 5) Modifying existing components to support lazy loading, and 6) Testing lazy loading behavior and performance impact.",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity as it involves implementing a sophisticated lazy loading system using Intersection Observer and dynamic imports. It requires modifying the existing component registration system while maintaining backward compatibility. The implementation needs careful error handling and performance testing."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Audit and Update Dependencies",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Dependency Audit and Update process into subtasks including: 1) Running security audit and identifying vulnerabilities, 2) Using depcheck to find unused dependencies, 3) Identifying and consolidating duplicate dependencies, 4) Creating and testing the cleanup script, and 5) Verifying application functionality after dependency updates.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves analyzing and modifying the project's dependencies, which requires careful consideration of each change's impact. The complexity comes from the need to identify unused dependencies without breaking functionality and ensuring security vulnerabilities are addressed. The cleanup script adds implementation complexity."

      "reasoning": "This task requires understanding of GitHub Actions workflows and Docker build processes. The complexity comes from properly configuring caching mechanisms for both dependencies and Docker layers, ensuring proper versioning, and maintaining build performance. Testing the complete pipeline adds additional complexity."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Documentation and Rollback Procedures task into subtasks including: 1) Creating comprehensive web component usage documentation, 2) Documenting the build and deployment process, 3) Developing detailed rollback procedures for both deployment and code changes, and 4) Testing the documented procedures to verify accuracy and completeness.",
      "reasoning": "While this task doesn't involve complex implementation, it requires comprehensive understanding of all the previous tasks to create accurate documentation. The rollback procedures need to be carefully designed and tested to ensure they work in emergency situations. The complexity comes from ensuring completeness and accuracy across multiple systems."
