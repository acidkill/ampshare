Product Requirements Document: Web Component Initialization and Build Optimization
1. Overview
This PRD outlines the requirements for fixing the web component initialization error and optimizing the Docker build process for the Ampshare application. The primary issues to address are:

Duplicate web component registration causing console errors
Slow Docker builds
Inefficient code organization affecting build times
2. Problem Statement
2.1 Web Component Initialization Error
Error: Uncaught Error: A custom element with name 'mce-autosize-textarea' has already been defined
Impact: Causes JavaScript errors in the console and may affect component behavior
Root Cause: Multiple instances of the same web component being registered
2.2 Build and Performance Issues
Slow Docker build times
Inefficient caching in the build process
Unoptimized dependencies and assets
3. Requirements
3.1 Web Component Fixes (High Priority)
3.1.1 Web Component Registration
[ ] Implement a singleton pattern for web component registration
[ ] Add check to prevent duplicate component registration
[ ] Ensure proper cleanup of web components during hot module replacement
3.1.2 Error Handling
[ ] Add error boundaries around web component initialization
[ ] Implement graceful degradation for web component failures
[ ] Add error logging for web component registration issues
3.2 Build Optimization (High Priority)
3.2.1 Docker Build Optimization
[ ] Implement multi-stage builds
[ ] Optimize layer caching for dependencies
[ ] Reduce final image size by:
Using Alpine-based images
Removing development dependencies in production
Cleaning package cache after installation
3.2.2 Next.js Optimization
[ ] Configure Next.js for production optimization
[ ] Implement proper code splitting
[ ] Optimize static asset handling
[ ] Configure proper caching headers
3.3 Code Organization (Medium Priority)
3.3.1 Component Structure
[ ] Centralize web component registration
[ ] Implement lazy loading for non-critical components
[ ] Organize components by feature
3.3.2 Dependency Management
[ ] Audit and update dependencies
[ ] Remove unused dependencies
[ ] Consolidate duplicate dependencies
4. Technical Specifications
4.1 Web Component Fix
typescript
CopyInsert
// web-components/registry.ts
const registeredComponents = new Set<string>();

export function registerWebComponent(name: string, constructor: CustomElementConstructor) {
  if (!customElements.get(name) && !registeredComponents.has(name)) {
    customElements.define(name, constructor);
    registeredComponents.add(name);
  }
}
4.2 Dockerfile Optimization
dockerfile
CopyInsert
# Stage 1: Build
FROM node:20-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Production
FROM node:20-alpine
WORKDIR /app
ENV NODE_ENV=production
COPY --from=builder /app/package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY --from=builder /app/.next ./.next
COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
5. Non-Functional Requirements
5.1 Performance
Build time should be reduced by at least 40%
Final Docker image size should be under 200MB
Web component initialization should not throw duplicate registration errors
5.2 Reliability
All existing functionality must be preserved
No regressions in performance or behavior
Proper error handling for all web component operations
5.3 Maintainability
Clear documentation for web component usage
Comments explaining optimization choices
Updated README with build and deployment instructions
6. Testing Requirements
6.1 Unit Tests
[ ] Test web component registration
[ ] Verify no duplicate registrations
[ ] Test error handling
6.2 Integration Tests
[ ] Verify component functionality in different scenarios
[ ] Test with multiple instances of the same component
6.3 Performance Tests
[ ] Measure build time before and after optimizations
[ ] Verify image size reduction
[ ] Test application startup time
7. Deployment
7.1 CI/CD Updates
[ ] Update CI/CD pipeline with new build process
[ ] Add build cache for dependencies
[ ] Implement proper versioning
7.2 Rollback Plan
[ ] Create rollback procedure
[ ] Document rollback steps
[ ] Test rollback process
8. Success Metrics
Build Time: At least 40% reduction in build time
Image Size: Final image size under 200MB
Errors: No duplicate web component registration errors
Performance: No degradation in application performance
9. Dependencies
Node.js v20+
Docker
Next.js 15.3.3
Web Components v1
10. Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation | |------|--------|------------|------------| | Breaking changes in web components | High | Medium | Thorough testing and code review | | Build optimization side effects | High | Low | Implement in stages with testing | | Dependency conflicts | Medium | Medium | Pin dependency versions and test updates |

11. Timeline
Phase 1: Web Component Fixes - 2 days
Phase 2: Build Optimization - 3 days
Phase 3: Testing and Validation - 2 days
Phase 4: Deployment - 1 day
Total Estimated Time: 8 business days
