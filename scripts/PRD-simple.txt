# Web Component and Build Optimization PRD

## 1. Web Component Fixes (High Priority)
- [ ] Implement singleton pattern for web component registration
- [ ] Add check to prevent duplicate component registration
- [ ] Ensure proper cleanup during hot module replacement
- [ ] Add error boundaries and logging

## 2. Build Optimization (High Priority)
- [ ] Implement multi-stage Docker builds
- [ ] Optimize layer caching
- [ ] Reduce final image size (target <200MB)
- [ ] Configure Next.js production optimization

## 3. Code Organization (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Centralize web component registration
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for non-critical components
- [ ] Audit and update dependencies

## 4. Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for component registration
- [ ] Integration tests for build process
- [ ] Performance benchmarks before/after optimizations
